/**
 * Design System
 * Main export point for the design system
 *
 * ALL design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, etc.) are defined in:
 * src/index.css using @theme directive (Tailwind v4 pattern)
 *
 * This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
 * Components use Tailwind utilities directly: text-xl, p-4, bg-purple-700, etc.
 *
 * No TypeScript token files needed - CSS custom properties are accessed via Tailwind.
 */

// Currently no exports needed - all tokens are in CSS @theme
// Components use Tailwind utilities directly
