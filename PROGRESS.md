## Session: 2025-10-27 (Continued)

### Focus: Input Range Bounds Bug Fix & Claude Code CLI Repair

#### ✅ Completed

**1. CRITICAL BUG FIX: Input Range Bounds Preventing Typing**

**Problem Discovered:**
- User reported inability to type numbers in Gross Funded Amount field
- Previous implementation from earlier session was fundamentally broken
- Min/max validation in `onChange` blocked ALL intermediate values during typing
- Example: Trying to type "15000" with min="10000" → First digit "1" = fails check → input never updates

**Root Cause:**
- Both `CurrencyInput.tsx` and `NumberInput.tsx` had overly aggressive validation
- Lines 54-61 (CurrencyInput) and 43-50 (NumberInput) rejected input if value < min
- React controlled input best practice: validate on blur, not on change

**Solution Applied:**
- **Removed validation from `onChange` handlers** - Allow intermediate values while typing
- **Added validation to `onBlur` handlers** - Clamp to min/max when user finishes editing
- **Preserved increment/decrement bounds** - Buttons still respect limits immediately

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/form/CurrencyInput.tsx:42-81` - Moved validation from onChange to onBlur with clamping logic
- `src/components/form/CurrencyInput.tsx:83-99` - Cleaned onChange to allow free typing
- `src/components/form/NumberInput.tsx:38-77` - Added handleBlur with clamping, removed onChange validation
- `src/components/form/NumberInput.tsx:86` - Added onBlur handler to input element

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Can type "1" → "15" → "150" → "15000" freely
- ✅ Typing "5000" + blur → auto-corrects to $10,000 (min)
- ✅ Typing "150000" + blur → auto-corrects to $100,000 (max)
- ✅ Valid values (15000) stay as entered and format properly
- ✅ Increment/decrement controls still enforce bounds immediately

**User Experience Impact:**
- **Before**: Completely broken - couldn't type anything below min value
- **After**: Natural flow - type freely, auto-correct on blur if needed

---

**2. SYSTEM FIX: Claude Code CLI Installation Conflict**

**Problem Discovered:**
- User noticed version mismatch: `claude --version` showed 2.0.8
- Latest version is 2.0.28 (released 3 hours prior, October 28, 2025)
- 20-version difference indicated significant installation issue
- Status command showed confusing "add-from-claude-desktop" message at bottom

**Investigation:**
- Found **two conflicting installations**:
  1. **Old (2.0.8)** in `~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/` (installed Oct 5, 2025)
  2. **New (2.0.28)** in `~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.1/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/`
- Shell was using old version because `~/.npm-global/bin/` appeared earlier in PATH
- Active executable: `/Users/chris/.npm-global/bin/claude → 2.0.8`
- Correct executable (unused): `/Users/chris/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.1/bin/claude → 2.0.28`

**Root Cause:**
- User has NVM (Node Version Manager) as primary npm package manager
- At some point, packages were installed to custom `~/.npm-global/` directory
- This created a precedence conflict where outdated global install overrode NVM's current install
- npm global prefix set to NVM: `/Users/chris/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.1`
- But shell found old `~/.npm-global/bin/claude` first

**Solution Applied:**
```bash
# Attempted automatic update (failed to remove old installation)
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Manually removed outdated installation
rm -rf ~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code
rm ~/.npm-global/bin/claude

# Cleared shell hash table to force PATH re-scan
hash -r
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Version: `2.0.28 (Claude Code)` - Latest release
- ✅ Location: `/Users/chris/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.1/bin/claude`
- ✅ MCP Servers: Working (context7, playwright, mui-mcp)
- ✅ Git Integration: Working
- ✅ Status Command: Working correctly

**What This Means:**
- Claude Code CLI is now on latest version with newest features from Sept 29, 2025 2.0 release
- Includes: VS Code extension support, improved status visibility, checkpoint system
- All tools and MCP servers functioning correctly
- No more version conflicts between npm installations

**About "add-from-claude-desktop" Message:**
- Not an error - just a helpful hint in status output
- Suggests you can copy MCP server configs from Claude Desktop to CLI
- Can be ignored - current MCP setup is working correctly

**Directory Structure Clarification:**
1. **`~/.claude/`** - Claude Code CLI data (history, settings, MCP config at `~/.claude.json`)
2. **`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`** - Claude Desktop app data (separate application)
3. **These are separate apps** with separate configurations - working as intended
4. **Project directory**: `/Users/chris/Claude/ogion-proto` (capital C is canonical path)
   - Note: macOS is case-insensitive, so `/Users/chris/claude/` and `/Users/chris/Claude/` are the same
   - Git uses canonical form with capital C

**Files NOT Modified:**
- No root folder structure changes made
- No directory moves or renames
- Only removed duplicate/outdated npm package installation
- All project files and configurations remain untouched

**Current State:**
- ✅ Claude Code CLI: 2.0.28 (latest)
- ✅ Project: `/Users/chris/Claude/ogion-proto`
- ✅ Git: Clean working tree with 23 modified files, 14 untracked (normal dev state)
- ✅ MCP: context7, playwright, mui-mcp active and working
- ✅ Project-level MCP config: `.mcp.json` with 7 Figma server variants (for future use)

**3. Metrics Header Stability** (from earlier session)
- Fixed vertical jumping when metric values appear/disappear
- Solution: Fixed height (`h-[24px]`) + always-rendered content (non-breaking space `\u00A0`)
- Individual opacity transitions per value (not global)
- Labels always visible at `opacity-40`, values fade in at `opacity-100`
- File: `src/screens/DealInput.tsx:259-318`

**4. Design System Audit** (from earlier session)
- Scanned all form input components for design system compliance
- Result: 100% compliance across all form inputs
- All components properly use centralized `inputStyles.ts`
- Confirmed `BaseUISlider` is dashboard-specific (not a form component)

**5. Documentation Updates**
- Fixed CLAUDE.md contradictions (line 551 incorrect token reference)
- Moved `BaseUISlider` from "Form Controls" to "Dashboard" components
- Updated dashboard status to "Complete"
- **Updated PROGRESS.md** - Added comprehensive documentation of bug fix and CLI repair

#### 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **React Controlled Input Validation Best Practices**
   - **WRONG**: Validate in `onChange` - blocks intermediate values during typing
   - **RIGHT**: Validate in `onBlur` - allow free typing, clamp when done
   - Reason: User needs to type through invalid intermediate states to reach valid final value
   - Example: Typing "15000" with min="10000" → must allow "1", "15", "150", etc.

2. **npm Global Installation Conflicts**
   - Multiple npm installations (NVM + custom directories) can create PATH conflicts
   - Outdated packages in earlier PATH locations override newer correct versions
   - Solution: Use `which <command>` to verify which binary is executing
   - Always check package.json version in actual executable location
   - Manual cleanup required when `npm uninstall -g` fails to remove old installations

3. **macOS Case-Insensitive Filesystem**
   - `/Users/chris/claude/` and `/Users/chris/Claude/` are the same directory
   - Git uses canonical form (capital C), shell may use lowercase
   - Can cause confusion in file tagging and path resolution
   - Best practice: Use canonical form consistently

4. **Flexbox Height Stability**
   - Use fixed height + non-breaking space instead of conditional rendering
   - Prevents layout reflow when content appears/disappears

5. **Component Separation**
   - Dashboard components (BaseUISlider) vs form components have different styling needs
   - BaseUISlider uses `duration-150` (appropriate for Base UI wrapper)
   - Form inputs use `duration-[150ms]` (references design system token)

6. **Design System Workflow**
   - All form inputs share `inputStyles.ts` - excellent centralized pattern
   - Prevents duplication and ensures consistency

#### 📁 Files Modified

**Code Changes:**
- `src/components/form/NumberInput.tsx` - **FIX**: Moved validation from onChange to onBlur, added clamping logic
- `src/components/form/CurrencyInput.tsx` - **FIX**: Moved validation from onChange to onBlur, added clamping logic
- `src/screens/DealInput.tsx` - Updated bounds (from earlier session), fixed metrics header stability

**Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Fixed contradictions and outdated information
- `PROGRESS.md` - Updated with comprehensive bug fix and CLI repair documentation

**System (npm global packages):**
- Removed: `~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.0.8`
- Removed: `~/.npm-global/bin/claude` symlink
- Now using: `~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.1/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.0.28`

#### 🎯 Next Session

**Planned Focus**: Multi-part iteration across navigation, inputs, layout, and visuals

**Work Items**:
1. **Top Nav Unification** - Standardize navigation header across all screens
2. **Deal Input Type & Token Check** - Review input components for type safety and design token compliance
3. **Container Balance & Summary Iteration** - Refine layout containers and summary sections
4. **Deal Home Card Design** - Polish Deal Select card visuals
5. **Background App Visuals** - Finalize app-wide background treatments

## Session: 2025-10-30

### Focus: Deal Benchmarking Charts - Critical Bug Fix & Animation Polish

#### ✅ Completed

**1. CRITICAL BUG FIX: Scatter Plot Data Points Invisible**

**Problem Discovered:**
- User reported scatter plots showing only one data point instead of full datasets
- Expected 38 marketplace points + 20 funder portfolio points + 2 current deal markers = 60 total points
- Visual inspection showed all 73 circles rendered in DOM (correct count with multiple marketplace instances)
- **Root cause**: All circles had `radius="0px"` (r: null, computedR: "0px")

**Investigation:**
```
DOM inspection showed:
<circle r="null" ...>  // ❌ No radius calculated
computedR: "0px"       // ❌ Browser renders invisible circles
```

**Root Cause:**
- Custom Recharts shape function used `props.r` which was undefined
- Recharts Scatter component does NOT pass pre-calculated radius to custom shape functions
- ZAxis provided data but shape function didn't use it
- Previous implementation:
```typescript
shape={(props: any) => {
  return <circle r={props.r} />  // ❌ props.r is undefined
}}
```

**Solution Applied:**
- Implemented manual radius calculation from ZAxis data using area interpolation
- Formula: `area = minArea + normalizedZ * (maxArea - minArea)` → `radius = sqrt(area / PI)`
- Added proper min/max Z-value calculations from dataset
- Now circles render with sizes 4.7px to 8px based on deal size

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Calculate radius from z value (dealSize) and ZAxis range [70, 200]
const minArea = 70;
const maxArea = 200;
const minZ = Math.min(...chartData.map(d => d.z || d.dealSize));
const maxZ = Math.max(...chartData.map(d => d.z || d.dealSize));
const zValue = payload.z || payload.dealSize || 100;

const normalizedZ = (zValue - minZ) / (maxZ - minZ);
const area = minArea + normalizedZ * (maxArea - minArea);
const radius = Math.sqrt(area / Math.PI);  // Convert area to radius

return (
  <circle
    cx={cx}
    cy={cy}
    r={radius}  // ✅ Now properly calculated
    fill={props.fill}
    stroke={variant === 'marketplace' ? '#6b5fb5' : '#0d9488'}
    strokeWidth={1}
    opacity={0.85}
  />
);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/charts/ScatterPlotChart.tsx:384-426` - Added radius calculation to custom shape function
- `src/components/charts/ScatterPlotChart.tsx:42-116` - Seeded random generators (existing, verified consistency)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Marketplace chart: 38 purple points visible with varying sizes
- ✅ Funder portfolio chart: 20 teal points visible with varying sizes
- ✅ Current deal markers: Blue circles at correct positions
- ✅ Color differentiation working: Purple (#8b7fd4) vs Teal (#14b8a6)
- ✅ Size variation working: Larger circles = larger deal sizes
- ✅ Data consistency: Seeded random maintains same patterns across re-renders

**User Experience Impact:**
- **Before**: Charts appeared empty except for current deal marker
- **After**: Full dataset visualizations showing marketplace breadth vs portfolio concentration

---

**2. ANIMATION SPEED IMPROVEMENTS: Chart Transitions**

**Goal**: Make tab switching animations snappier with strong ease-out motion.

**Context**: User requested faster animations when switching between Funding Amount / TIB / Industry / Region tabs in Deal Benchmarking section.

**Changes Applied:**

**Scatter Plot Charts:**
- Updated `animationDuration={300}` (was default 400ms)
- Added `animationEasing="ease-out"` to:
  - Scatter components (2x - marketplace/funder data points)
  - Bar components (2x - for bar chart overlays)
  - XAxis components (2x - horizontal axis labels)
  - YAxis components (2x - vertical axis labels)

**Background Check Cards (for consistency):**
- Card transitions: `duration-300` → `duration-200 ease-out`
- Progress ring: `duration-1000` → `duration-500 ease-out`
- Risk bar: `duration-1000` → `duration-500 ease-out`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/charts/ScatterPlotChart.tsx:384-472` - Animation props on 6 Recharts components
- `src/components/dashboard/BackgroundCheckCard.tsx:45,141,206,279,312` - Transition speeds

**Result:**
- Tab switches now feel immediate and responsive (300ms vs previous 400ms+)
- Ease-out motion creates natural deceleration at end of transitions
- Consistent animation timing across all dashboard chart interactions

---

**3. TAB SPACING & HOVER STATE POLISH: Deal Benchmarking**

**Goal**: Improve usability of benchmarking tabs with better spacing and visual feedback.

**User Requirements:**
1. More padding between tabs → 20px gap
2. Wider tap areas (horizontal padding) → added `px-3`
3. Maintain same height and text size → no changes to these
4. Add faint hover fill → 15% opacity purple

**Changes Applied:**
```typescript
// Before:
<div className="flex items-center gap-6">  // 24px gap
  <button className="text-xs ...">

// After:
<div className="flex items-center gap-5">  // 20px gap
  <button className="text-xs ... px-3 rounded-t hover:bg-purple-700/15">
```

**Hover State Styles:**
- Active tab: `text-purple-700 border-b-2 border-purple-700`
- Inactive tab: `text-neutral-900 hover:text-neutral-700 hover:bg-purple-700/15`
- Added `rounded-t` for visual polish on hover background
- Consistent across all 4 tabs (Funding Amount, TIB, Industry, Region)

**Files Modified:**
- `playground/pages/DashboardV2.tsx:292-333` - Tab button styles

**User Experience Impact:**
- Better touch target sizes for mobile/tablet interactions
- Clear visual feedback on hover (subtle purple tint)
- Improved visual breathing room between options (20px vs 24px)
- Professional polish with rounded top corners on hover

---

#### 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **Recharts Custom Shape Functions**
   - Recharts does NOT pass `props.r` to custom shape functions
   - Must manually calculate radius from ZAxis data if using custom shapes
   - Formula: Interpolate z-value to area range, then convert area to radius
   - Always check DOM for actual rendered attributes when debugging visualization issues

2. **Area to Radius Conversion**
   - Area-based interpolation creates more perceptually uniform size differences
   - Formula: `radius = sqrt(area / PI)` (from circle area formula: A = πr²)
   - Allows control over visual size range independent of data range

3. **Seeded Random Generation**
   - Linear congruential generator: `value = (value * 9301 + 49297) % 233280`
   - Ensures consistent mock data across re-renders for reliable testing
   - Different seeds (12345 vs 54321) create distinct but reproducible datasets

4. **Recharts Animation Props**
   - `animationDuration`: milliseconds (default 400ms)
   - `animationEasing`: CSS easing function names ("ease-out", "ease-in", "linear")
   - Must apply to ALL animated components (Scatter, Bar, XAxis, YAxis) for consistency
   - 300ms is optimal for "snappy" feel without feeling jarring

5. **Tailwind Opacity Modifiers**
   - `/15` syntax = 15% opacity (e.g., `bg-purple-700/15`)
   - Works with any color utility: backgrounds, borders, text
   - More maintainable than hardcoded RGBA values

6. **Strategic Data Visualization**
   - Marketplace data: Broad MOIC range (1.00-1.55), even distribution across industries/regions
   - Funder portfolio: Narrow MOIC range (1.25-1.50), concentrated (80% one industry, 85% one region)
   - Visual differentiation reinforces strategic narrative (explore vs focus)

#### 📁 Files Modified

**Code Changes:**
- `src/components/charts/ScatterPlotChart.tsx` - Fixed radius calculation, animation speed
- `src/components/dashboard/BackgroundCheckCard.tsx` - Animation speed consistency
- `playground/pages/DashboardV2.tsx` - Tab spacing and hover states

**Documentation:**
- `PROGRESS.md` - This session summary

#### 🎯 Current State

## Session: 2025-10-29

### Focus: Login Screen Visual Design + Dashboard Charts with Recharts

#### ✅ Completed

**1. LOGIN SCREEN BACKGROUND VISUAL DESIGN**

**Goal**: Add sophisticated abstract visual elements to login screen background while maintaining focus on login card.

**Approach**: Hybrid design combining generated abstract art + coded SVG elements.

**Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Abstract Background Art Generation**
- Used canvas-design skill to create museum-quality abstract composition
- Created "Warm Foundations" design philosophy emphasizing:
  - Organic forms with asymmetric balance
  - Layered transparency for depth
  - Warm neutral palette (beiges, taupes, ochres, warm grays)
  - Sophisticated restraint - noticed but not intrusive
- Generated 2400x1600px PNG with 5 layers + texture overlay
- Output: `public/assets/login-background.png` (107KB optimized)
- Palette: 8 warm neutral tones coordinated with existing `#E8E2D9` background

**Phase 2: Enhanced SVG Decorative Elements**
- Bottom left: Flowing organic curves with warm taupe tones (20% opacity)
- Top right: Elegant curved paths creating movement (20% opacity)
- Center accents: Vertical curve + organic blob shapes (12-15% opacity)
- Scattered circular gradient accents positioned strategically (3 total)
- All elements use `pointer-events-none` to preserve interactivity

**Phase 3: CSS Integration**
- Background image with cover sizing and center positioning
- Radial gradient overlay for atmospheric blending
- Multiple layered elements create depth without overwhelming
- Fixed Vite base URL path issue (`/ozone-proto-v0.7/assets/login-background.png`)

**Phase 4: Responsive Testing**
- Desktop (1280px): Full artwork visible, balanced composition ✅
- Tablet (768px): Scales beautifully, maintains visual interest ✅
- Mobile (375px): Background adapts gracefully, login card prominent ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/screens/Login.tsx` - Enhanced with background art + refined SVG elements
- `public/assets/login-background.png` - Generated abstract artwork (NEW)
- `.claude/skills/canvas-design/warm-foundations-philosophy.md` - Design philosophy (NEW)

**User Feedback**: Initial design felt "too blobby" - simple organic circles weren't sophisticated enough. Noted for future iteration.

---

**2. DASHBOARD CHARTS IMPLEMENTATION WITH RECHARTS**

**Goal**: Replace placeholder text with functional, styled charts based on Figma design.

**Figma Analysis:**
- URL: `https://www.figma.com/design/tqkSthHAPWKVigxaA9iDRz/Ogion-v0.2-design?node-id=579-24066`
- Identified 3 chart requirements:
  1. "Offer history" - Area chart with purple gradient
  2. "Forecast" - Multi-line chart with 3 colored lines
  3. "Overview" - Horizontal progress bars (6 rows)

**Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Setup**
- Installed `recharts` package (added 36 packages)
- Created `src/components/charts/` directory structure

**Phase 2: Chart Components Created**

1. **OfferHistoryChart.tsx**
   - Type: Recharts `<AreaChart>` with smooth monotone curve
   - Visual: Purple gradient fill (`#9b87f5` → `#d4c5f9`)
   - Data: 30 days of mock offer values ($60K-$90K range with realistic fluctuation)
   - Features: Grid lines, axis labels, hover tooltips with currency formatting
   - Size: 220px height, responsive width

2. **ForecastChart.tsx**
   - Type: Recharts `<LineChart>` with 3 lines
   - Lines:
     - Purple gradient (Funding)
     - Pink gradient (Volume)
     - Peach gradient (Revenue)
   - Data: 12-month projections with wavy patterns (different frequencies for visual interest)
   - Features: Legend, smooth curves, staggered animations, hover tooltips
   - Size: 220px height, responsive width

3. **OverviewBars.tsx**
   - Type: Custom horizontal progress bars (not Recharts)
   - Bars: 6 rows with colors matching Figma:
     - Teal (#14b8a6)
     - Green (#22c55e)
     - Light green (#86efac)
     - Teal (#14b8a6)
     - Orange (#f97316)
     - Red (#ef4444)
   - Features: Animated fill on load (500ms ease-out), "Read more" links
   - Layout: Label (left) + Bar (center flex-1) + Link (right)

**Phase 3: Dashboard Integration**
- Added imports to `src/screens/Dashboard.tsx`
- Replaced placeholder text in BOTH Layout A and Layout B
- Two charts side-by-side in 2-column grid (md:col-span-6)
- Overview bars in full-width section below (col-span-12)
- Proper card styling: `bg-neutral-300 rounded-2xl p-5 shadow-sm`
- Section headers: "Offer history", "Forecast", "Overview"

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/charts/OfferHistoryChart.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/charts/ForecastChart.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/charts/OverviewBars.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/charts/index.ts` (NEW)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/screens/Dashboard.tsx` - Integrated all 3 charts in both layout modes
- `package.json` - Added recharts dependency

**Testing Notes:**
- Charts integrated successfully in code
- Multiple dev server instances caused some testing issues
- Charts should be visible after clean restart of dev server
- Located issue: Correct file path confirmed (`playground/pages/Dashboard.tsx` imports from `src/screens/Dashboard.tsx`)

---

#### 🎯 Current State

**Login Screen:**
- ✅ Abstract background art with warm tones
- ✅ Enhanced SVG decorative elements
- ✅ Fully responsive (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- ⚠️ User noted design needs more sophistication (less "blobby")

**Dashboard Charts:**
- ✅ Recharts installed and configured
- ✅ 3 chart components created with mock data
- ✅ Integrated into both dashboard layouts
- ✅ Styled to match existing design system
- ⚠️ Needs visual verification after clean dev server restart

**Design System:**
- ✅ All tokens remain in `src/index.css` @theme (no violations)
- ✅ Charts use Tailwind utilities + inline styles for Recharts-specific colors
- ✅ No new design token files created
- ✅ Maintained pure CSS architecture

---

#### 📁 Files Modified This Session

**New Files:**
- `public/assets/login-background.png` - Generated abstract artwork (107KB)
- `src/components/charts/OfferHistoryChart.tsx` - Area chart component
- `src/components/charts/ForecastChart.tsx` - Multi-line chart component
- `src/components/charts/OverviewBars.tsx` - Progress bars component
- `src/components/charts/index.ts` - Chart exports
- `.claude/skills/canvas-design/warm-foundations-philosophy.md` - Design philosophy

**Modified Files:**
- `src/screens/Login.tsx` - Background art + SVG enhancements
- `src/screens/Dashboard.tsx` - Charts integration (both layouts)
- `package.json` - Added recharts dependency

---

#### 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **Canvas-Design Skill Workflow**
   - Generate design philosophy first (4-6 paragraphs)
   - Express visually with layered composition
   - Requires Python PIL (Pillow) library
   - Output as PNG + markdown philosophy document

2. **Recharts Integration**
   - Gradient definitions via SVG `<defs>` + `<linearGradient>`
   - Mock data generation with Math.sin/cos for realistic waves
   - ResponsiveContainer required for proper sizing
   - Tooltip customization via contentStyle/labelStyle/itemStyle

3. **Multi-File Dashboard Architecture**
   - `playground/pages/Dashboard.tsx` imports from `src/screens/Dashboard.tsx`
   - Changes to src/screens are correct location
   - Both Layout A and Layout B need identical updates

4. **Dev Server Management**
   - Multiple parallel servers can cause port conflicts
   - Use `pkill -f "vite"` to clean up all instances
   - Fresh restart recommended after major changes

---

#### 🎯 Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Verify charts are visible after dev server restart
2. Get user feedback on chart styling, colors, data representation
3. Iterate on login background design (user wants less "blobby", more sophisticated)

**Potential Follow-ups:**
- Add real data connections to charts (replace mock data)
- Implement chart interactions (click, filter, zoom)
- Create additional chart types based on Figma (more empty placeholders remain)
- Refine login background with different aesthetic approach:
  - Options: Geometric/structured, flowing lines, fine textures, or minimalist gradients
- Responsive chart behavior on mobile breakpoints
